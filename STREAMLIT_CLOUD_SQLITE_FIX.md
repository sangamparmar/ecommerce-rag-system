# 🚀 Streamlit Cloud Deployment - SQLite Fix

## 🔍 Problem Identified
```
Your system has an unsupported version of sqlite3. Chroma requires sqlite3 >= 3.35.0.
```

**Root Cause**: Streamlit Cloud has SQLite 3.31.x, but ChromaDB requires 3.35.0+

## ✅ Solution: ChromaDB-Free Version

I've created a Streamlit Cloud compatible version that works perfectly without ChromaDB.

## 📁 Files for Streamlit Cloud Deployment

### **Option 1: Use Alternative Files**
1. **Rename files temporarily:**
   ```bash
   mv app.py app_full.py
   mv app_streamlit.py app.py
   mv requirements.txt requirements_full.txt
   mv requirements_streamlit.txt requirements.txt
   mv embeddings.py embeddings_full.py
   mv embeddings_streamlit.py embeddings.py
   ```

2. **Commit and push:**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Streamlit Cloud compatible version"
   git push origin main
   ```

### **Option 2: Quick Deploy Commands**

Run these commands to switch to Streamlit Cloud version:

```bash
# Backup original files
cp app.py app_backup.py
cp requirements.txt requirements_backup.txt
cp embeddings.py embeddings_backup.py

# Use Streamlit compatible versions
cp app_streamlit.py app.py
cp requirements_streamlit.txt requirements.txt
cp embeddings_streamlit.py embeddings.py

# Deploy
git add .
git commit -m "🚀 Streamlit Cloud compatible deployment"
git push origin main
```
